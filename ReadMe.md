## Horiseon Homepage

This is my attempt on the website with amendments to the html file itself and the stylesheet.

The webpage has a navigation bar (header), 3 section, aside bar which also consists of 3 section aswell and lastly a footer.

Below is the preview of what the webpage should be looking like and the link to the live page is https://mohamedisaaq0.github.io/week1-homework/
